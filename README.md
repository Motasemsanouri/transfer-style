# 🎨 AI Style Transfer Web App

**AI Style Transfer** is an interactive web application built with Streamlit and TensorFlow that allows users to apply the artistic style of one image to the content of another. Powered by deep learning and TensorFlow Hub, this tool blends creativity and AI to produce stunning results in seconds.

## 🌟 Features

- Upload your **content** and **style** images.
- Stylize images using a pretrained model from [TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/google/magenta/arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2).
- View side-by-side comparisons of original and stylized outputs.
- Download the stylized result as a PNG.
- Optional local implementation of neural style transfer using VGG19 for offline usage.
